Figure Ground Diagram
======
A web application to facilitate the production of figure-ground diagrams for Georgia Tech's City Literacy course in Barcelona.

## What is a Figure Ground Diagram?
A type of diagram that allows urban planning researchers to view the urban form of a city through a black and white visualization of one square mile of that city's street network, whether it be a complex one or not.

## My Approach
My implementation of this project is inspired by [Christian Battaglia's](https://github.com/cdbattags) application that is currently being used in the course, [One Square Mile](https://cdbattaglia.com/one-square-mile).
